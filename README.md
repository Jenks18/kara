# Kacha — AI-Powered Receipt Capture & Expense Tracking 📸💰

A multi-platform expense tracking app for businesses. Photograph any receipt, auto-extract data via AI + eTIMS QR scanning, group expenses into reports, and manage multi-tenant workspaces.

**"Kacha"** is Swahili for "take a picture" — snap any receipt, and our AI extracts all the details instantly.
